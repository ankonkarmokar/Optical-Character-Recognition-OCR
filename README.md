# OCR Project

This Optical Character Recognition (OCR) project extracts and converts text from images into machine-readable, editable formats. The project is implemented in Python, using the Tesseract OCR engine for high accuracy in text extraction. It is designed to be easy to set up and extend for various OCR tasks.

## Project

The goal of this project is to provide a simple, effective way to extract text from scanned documents, photos, or PDFs. The tool is primarily built with Python and leverages the Tesseract OCR engine, which is widely used for text recognition. The project includes functionality for processing images, and extracting text for further processing or analysis.

## Features

- **Image to Text Conversion**: Convert images (JPEG, PNG, etc.) to editable text.
- **Configurable OCR Settings**: Adjust settings like page segmentation mode (PSM) and language for better accuracy.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integration into other Python-based workflows.

## Libraries

This project uses the following libraries:

- **pytesseract**: A Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR to extract text from images and PDFs.
- **Pillow**: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork used for image processing.

Install the dependencies using the following:
```bash
pip install pytesseract pillow
```
